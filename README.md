# papercut_working

* **We need a title.**


## Things Colin is working on currently:

~~* Creating a parallaxing effect for the background
  We have two methods for this, we can use perspective cameras (not as great) or stick with orthographic and set fore/background elements to move at a different rate in the opposite direction of the character.~~



~~* Creating loading systems
  Optimization is key here. Hopefully, a dynamic loading system can be made so as our character falls through each hole into the next level, it can load. _Hopefully._~~


## Things Karlie I think is working on

* Multi-choice dialogue system. - Almost there!

## Things left To-Do

* Build a "trapdoor" like system for falling to next level
* Build out levels
* Create dialogue
* Create character blueprints with animations
* Merge features
